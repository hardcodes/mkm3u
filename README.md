# mkm3u

A cli tool for creating m3u playlists.

The multimedia system of my car has a funny way of playing songs. So I use this tool to create playlists that force the system to play music in my desired order.

It must be called from the root directory of the thumbdrive with the music.


A big shoutout goes to the creators of the [m3u](https://github.com/mitchmindtree/m3u) crate. This tool is basically just a cli-wrapper.
